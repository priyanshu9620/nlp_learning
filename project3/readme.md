made a text generator type of thing which could predict the next word in the given text using lstm 
see the data was huge so i could able to train only upto 4 epochs which took an hour time and training acc was 40% 
so training it giving more time will be good
it is working some what ok ok with training data but with test data its horrible now 

steps followed:
1. took simple para type data and converted it into labelled data
2. used OHE at first and tokenization
3. using lstm and embedding layers
4. finally predicted output including next word and next 5 words like that
